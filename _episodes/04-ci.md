# Introduction

- According to Wikipedia: 

>In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies 
>to a shared mainline several times a day

- In optimal case, CI can be interpreted so that every single commit made by a developer will go through to entire pipeline to a test
ed package, ready to be deployed.
- ...and this pipeline should be automatic
- Workflows can differ, but a basic example could be:

  1. commit your code change to the repository 
  2. system runs all tests against the code 
  3. system builds the package 
  4. system installs the package to a clean server 
  5. test the build 
  6. test in production-like environment 
  7. deploy to production

- It can be possible to connect your CI server to for example chat services, so in case of a failure, the team gets the news instantly

# Available CI solutions

- There are plethora of products you can choose from
- Many of these are hosted by someone else, but you can also install your own
- Jenkins, Bamboo, Travis, Buildbot...

## Travis

- Travis is a nice option used commonly
- Basics of Travis were introduced in earlier modules:
  - Hosted CI service bound to GitHub
  - Tests are run on a dedicated virtual machine
  - Supports a wide variety of languages, including R, Python, Perl and many many more
  - Supports also several analyzers
  - Free to use for Open Source projects. For serious use you might need a paid version.

## Jenkins

- Jenkins is an open source automation server
- There are tons of plugins available, to do almost anything
- You can deploy the Jenkins war file on top of an existing server or for example create a dedicated server with tools created by other people:
  - Ansible roles (you can find several!)
  - Deploy it as a Docker image

# Excercises

- Clone a repository from [https://github.com/coderefinery/ci-example-python](https://github.com/coderefinery/ci-example-python) to your GitHub page
  - If you have sufficient rights, you can also push the change directly and skip the parts below
- Create a feature branch
- One test is failing: fix it and submit a pull request to fix it

For this excercise, there is a Jenkins installation with a configured job to install the code and run the tests automatically.
